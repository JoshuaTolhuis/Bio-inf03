The European lobster, Homarus gammarus, has dark blue colour, despite it having high levels of the chromophore astaxanthin, a reddish pigment also prominent in red salmons.
This is because the astaxanthin in these lobsters is bound within a protein called crustacyanin.
This protein denatures at high temperatures which is why, when boiled, the lobster turns its expected orange red.
Crustacyanin is made up of sixteen monomers each being of one of the five different subunit types: A1, A2, A3, C1 and C2.
Two of these subtypes (A3 and C2) are not know in their unbound form which makes their molecular weight harder to predict.
The molecular weights of the other subunits are:
A1: 20,652 Da
A2: 19,670 Da
C1: 20,667 Da
The sixteen monomers are arranged into eight dimers, each subunit of the dimer contains four beta-pleated sheets that form a beta-barrel, and the astaxanthin molecule is positioned with one end in the apolar interior of the barrel and the other end projecting outwards. When these two subunits combine, the dimer forms a capsule structure around the two astaxanthin molecules. The dimer that is formed is called a beta-crustacyanin, the eight dimers collectively make up a single alpha-crustacyanin. The structure of this large protein complex creates a bathochromic shift in the perceived colour.
